# Processing 4.0 alpha 2

*Revision 1271 - 16 August 2020*


### Bug Fixes

* Fix broken macOS build [83](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/83)
* Bump JDK to 11.0.8
* Make macOS notarization part of the build process [24](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/24)

### Changes for AWT

To make way for more advanced rendering options, the exorcism of AWT from the base classes inside core has begun. More about that here: <https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Exorcising-AWT>

* Remove all usage of AWT from `PApplet` [55](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/55)
* Make edits to core so that AWT can be disabled and LWJGL can run [commit](https://github.com/codeanticode/processing-openjdk/commit/ac9abc18655daaa538ef16945687177334f3596e)
* Add `--disable-awt` option to `PApplet.main()`
* Fix for precision issues with PDF [5801](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5801#issuecomment-466632459)
* Implement `displayDensity(int)`, it's been returning the main display's value
* Show “displays have separate spaces” warning message when the param is unset
    * Show it in the console, which allows us to get rid of `JOptionPane`
    * Catalina seems to have it un-set, but the default is the same
* Move `selectInput/Output/Folder` to `ShimAWT` class
* remove the `java.awt.Frame` object from `PApplet`
* Move `loadImage()` into `ShimAWT`
* `desktopFile()` and `desktopPath()` methods are supported, unless we find they're trouble
* Move `ShimAWT.loadImage()` to the `PSurface` subclasses
* Move all `java.awt` and `javax.imageio` out of `PImage`
* Make the switch to `getModifiersEx()` instead of `getModifiers()` [4](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/4)
* Fix `PImage.save()` breakage due to AWT changes above (saving to PNG was broken in anything but the default renderer) [80](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/80)

# Processing 4.0 alpha 1

*Revision 1270 - 18 January 2020*

This is a massive update! With the help of [Sam Pottinger](https://gleap.org/), we're working to get Processing to run with Java 11. This will give us a more stable platform for the next few years.

In the process, there are also significant updates which include updated Java syntax support and lots of other long-awaited features.

We've started a [Changes in 4.0](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Changes-in-4.0) document to keep track of all the details.

We recommend using a different sketchbook location for 4.0, to avoid confusion with things that might be incompatible with your 3.0 work.
